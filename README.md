# Langton's ant  
a Cellular Automaton (CA) representing the evolution over time of the tiles of a grid under a langton's ant.  
# Building  
build with `cargo build --release` if you want optimizations (the executable will be found in `/target/release/langton-ant`) or
`cargo build` if you do not want them (in which case the executable will be found in `/target/debug/langton-ant`).  
# Running the simulation  
run with `cargo run` or manually execute the program from either `/target/release/langton-ant` or `/target/debug/langton-ant`.
